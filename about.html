          <p><img class="current-furs" src="./assets/images/band/current-furs.jpg" alt="psychedelic furs"/>If you sit and talk to many of the alternative rock artists
     dominating today’s music, you’ll find that many of them pay homage to
     the The Psychedelic Furs.  Led by front man and songwriter Richard
     Butler, the Furs won over fans and critics alike by combining poetic
     lyrics, innovative rhythms and melodies driven by an aggressive, punk
     desperation.  Through it all, the band scored major hits with "Love My
     Way," "Pretty In Pink," "Heaven," "The Ghost In You," and “Heartbreak
     Beat” in all releasing seven studio albums and spawning several
     compilations, a boxed set, and a live concert DVD. </p>
          <p>The Psychedelic Furs came together in England's emerging punk
     scene in 1977 initially consisting of Richard Butler (vocals), Tim
     Butler (bass guitar), Paul Wilson (drums), Duncan Kilburn (saxophone),
     and Roger Morris (guitars).  By 1979, this line up had expanded to a
     sextet with Vince Ely replacing Wilson on drums and John Ashton being
     added on guitar.</p>
          <p>The Furs debut, a self-titled album from 1980 was produced by
     Steve Lillywhite. The LP quickly established the band at radio in Europe
      and was a top 20 hit in the UK. The album also found success in
     Germany, Italy, France, Spain, New Zealand and Australia. The US version
      of the album was resequenced, yet failed to have as strong a commercial
      impact.</p>
          <p>The Furs did find success in the U.S. with their next release, 1981's <em>Talk Talk Talk</em>, which saw the band making its debut on the US album charts. In New Zealand, meanwhile, the band became immensely popular, as <em>Talk Talk Talk</em> reached the top ten in the charts, the first in a string of Furs' albums to chart in the New Zealand Top 10.</p>
          <p>In the UK, the album spun off two charting singles, "Dumb
     Waiters" and the original version of "Pretty in Pink". The latter song
     served as inspiration for the 1986 John Hughes film of the same name,
     and was re-recorded for the film’s platinum-selling soundtrack.</p>
          <p>In 1982, the Furs, now a four-piece with the departures of Morris and Kilburn, recorded <em>Forever Now</em>,
      with producer Todd Rundgren in Woodstock, New York. This album included
      "Love My Way", which became yet another UK and US chart hit.</p>
          <p>Ely left the band after <em>Forever Now</em>, although he would return for the 1988 single "All That Money Wants" and the 1989 album <em>Book of Days</em>.</p>
          <p>The Furs' 1984 release <em>Mirror Moves</em> was produced by
     Keith Forsey, and featured the songs "The Ghost in You" and "Heaven".
     Both charted in throughout the world, and "Heaven" became the band's
     highest charting UK hit at the time.  Strangely, however, "Heaven" was
     never released as a single in the U.S.  Instead, Columbia Records opted
     for "Here Come Cowboys", despite both international success and heavy
     MTV airplay for "Heaven". "Here Come Cowboys" failed to chart, but "The
     Ghost In You" was a hit single on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.</p>
          <p>By the mid-80s, the band had become a staple on both U.S.
     college and modern rock radio stations. Simultaneously, they were
     experiencing consistent mainstream success, placing several singles in
     the pop charts on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
          <p>In 1986, the band recorded a sax-infused version of "Pretty in
     Pink" for the soundtrack of the film of the same name.&nbsp; Butler later claimed that the success of "Pretty in
      Pink" caused the band to be pressured into entering the recording
     studio to record a follow-up release before they were ready. The result
     was <em>Midnight to Midnight</em>, their biggest Top 40 success to date,
      but also a more overtly commercial effort than the Furs had ever
     recorded before.  The album also featured the single "Heartbreak Beat",
     which became the Psychedelic Furs biggest hit yet on the U.S. Top 40.
     The album also featured drummer Paul Garisto and sax player Mars
     Williams, both of whom continue to tour with the band.</p>
          <p>In the wake of <em>Midnight To Midnight</em>, the Furs found
     themselves dissatisfied with their new commercial direction, and
     subsequently returned to a rawer sound with "All That Money Wants", a
     1988 track especially recorded for a best-of compilation album "All Of
     This And Nothing". 1989's <em>Book of Days</em>  and  1991's <em>World Outside</em> also saw a return to the earlier Furs' style. </p>
          <p>The Furs' steady chart success continued with three #1 hits on
     the newly-established U.S. Modern Rock chart between 1988 and 1991. "All
      That Money Wants" was a #1 hit in 1988, while "House" topped the chart
     in 1990, and "Until She Comes" was #1 in 1991.</p>
          <p>The band went on extended hiatus in the early 1990s, with the
     Butler brothers going on to create the band  “Love Spit Love” along with
      guitarist Richard Fortus and drummer Frank Ferrer. Love Spit Love
     released two albums and enjoyed some chart success as well. </p>
          <p>After spending most of the decade apart, the Butlers and Ashton
     reignited The Psychedelic Furs in 2000, and released a live album <em>Beautiful Chaos: Greatest Hits Live</em>,
      which also featured a new studio recording, "Alive (For Once In My
     Lifetime)." A DVD version of the performance included live versions of
     "Alive" and three other previously unreleased songs: "Anodyne (Better
     Days)," "Cigarette" and "Wrong Train."  Since then, lead singer Richard
     Butler has released an eponymous solo album produced by Jon Carin, and
     has hinted at the possibility of a new Psychedelic Furs album. </p>
          <p>These days, the band continues to tour around the world. The
     current Psychedelic Furs touring lineup remains  Richard Butler
     (vocals), Tim Butler (bass), Rich Good (guitar), Mars Williams
     (saxophone), Amanda Kramer (keyboards), and Paul Garisto (drums). </p>
